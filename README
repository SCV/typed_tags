# Typed Tags

Croogo Plugin for adding Tags in a node by typing them into a text area.

Requires [Croogo 1.3.2](http://github.com/croogo/croogo/downloads) or above.

## How to use

Use the TypedTags tab when adding or editing a node to add tags.

Tags must be (only) comma separated.

Taxonomies and terms are used if they exist and created if they don't.

## Todo

Ignore spaces after commas. Currently they are taken as part of the Tag.
